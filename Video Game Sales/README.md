# Video Game Analysis - 1990 - 2019

## Project Overview
This project explores trends in global video game sales across various platforms, genres, and franchises. Using Tableau for visualization and SQL/Excel for data exploration, I analyzed patterns in sales performance, including:

- Console-specific sales by genre
- Market share of each genre on individual platforms
- Success of game franchises

The goal is to uncover insights about what types of games perform best over time and across systems, and how sequels stack over time.

## Dashboards
All visualizations were created using Tableau Public Desktop and publicly accessable.

## Key Insights
- In the 2010's Call of Duty was a clear leader in combined sales in terms of franchise market share.
- The 2000's (up to 2009) saw a bit more parity in termes of genres
- Overall the Action Genre is still the leader from 1990 - 2019. This is likely due to franchises being ported and released on multiple systems and platforms.


## Future Work
- Find trustworthy sales data beyond 2019
- Compare franchise success based on sequels against the original game release
- Add 1 or 2 more sub-genres to get a more granular analysis on genres (id. Sports -> Soccer, Shooter -> First-Person)
- Integrate regional sales comparisons
