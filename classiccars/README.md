##  Overview
This project analyzes historical order data to answer business questions pertaining to the classic_cars data set. (More questions will be added)

* What products are commonly purchased together, and which combinations are rare?

* What does overall sales performance look like for 2004, broken down by product and geography?

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL querying, aggregation logic, and clear business-focused roeporting using Excel

## Product Pair Analysis

Product pairing was analyzed at the product line level to identify combinations frequently purchased together within the same order.

* Product line pairs
* Number of orders in which each pair appears
* Frequency classification (Frequently, Occasionally, Rarely)

This approach avoids inflated counts from multiple SKUs and focuses on true co-purchase behavior.
